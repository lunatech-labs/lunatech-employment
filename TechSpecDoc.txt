Functional specification

This issue consists in listing all candidate for the Rotterdam office. The list should be paginated.
We want to display the following columns:

Initial contact date
Name - String
Recruiter - String
CV - Link to a CV (to be implemented later)
Level - String
Languages - String
EU - Boolean
First interview - Date
Technical interview - Date
Final interview - Date
Start date - Date
Note - String
The default pagination shows 25 candidates per page. The list is sorted by Initial contact date.

Roles and permissions

There are no restrictions at this time and everyone can access the page and no login is required (yet).

Technical specification

The templates is already available in app/view/index.scala.html. It should be renamed to candidates.scala.html.

The list of candidates is available at the following URL:
GET /:office/candidates where :office is Rotterdam

And with the pagination:

GET /:office/candidates?size=20&page=1

You should use play embedded database (h2) and the evolutions mechanism to populate data.
The controller action should be implemented in the Application.scala file and should query the embedded database.
